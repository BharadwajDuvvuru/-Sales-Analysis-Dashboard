This repository contains SQL scripts designed to analyze customer and sales data. The queries provide insights into customer behavior, sales trends, and revenue generation. Below is a summary of the key functionalities:

Identify High-Spending Customers:

A query leveraging a Common Table Expression (CTE) to identify customers who spend over $100,000. Results are sorted in descending order of sales amount to highlight the top spenders.
Frequent Buyer Analysis:

Another CTE-based query to count purchase frequency by customer. This analysis helps to identify the most frequent buyers, sorted by the number of transactions.
Sales Trend Analysis:

Aggregates sales data by month using DATE_FORMAT to identify monthly sales trends, including total sales quantity and total sales amount. This query helps track seasonal performance and sales patterns.
Average Revenue Per Customer (ARPC):

Calculates the average revenue generated by each customer. Results are grouped by customer and ordered by their average sales amount to evaluate customer profitability.
These queries demonstrate the use of Common Table Expressions, aggregate functions, and grouping techniques to perform data analysis in a retail sales context.
